## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is building a web tool allowing users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs, etc. found on any given website. Utilizing the Aylien API to build a simple web interface which interacts with their NLP system, this tool returns relevant information about the article, e.g., whether the content is subjective (opinion) and/or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in the overall tone. This sort of data analysis is useful regarding filtering out 'fake' news (which, unfortunately, all too often proliferates on Social Media) because it is either actual news which has been distorted and/or distorted 'news' which is spun as being false/untrue. Either way, when employed properly, this sort of technology is very useful.
